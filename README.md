# Smart-Home-System
An app that uses machine learning to optimize the electricity consumption in a given household

This project was presented at Streethack hackathon by CodeStreet

Optimizes power consumption in households, based on daily routine and habits of the residents, thereby reducing the electricity bills by using Machine Learning; This application tracks real time parameters of the house which were used as base settings from which the optimized settings were calculated using probability, algebra, optimization techniques and the ML model; An Interface was prepared for the user to compare the recommended settings for the house appliances with the old settings and to see the units of energy saved by the recommended settings;
